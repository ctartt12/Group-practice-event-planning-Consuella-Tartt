 Group Practice
Instructions
Objective:
Form a group with 2-3 classmates to collaboratively design and implement reusable
functions that solve specific tasks.
Scenario: Your coding class is organizing an event to showcase programming
projects. Your team has been tasked with writing reusable JavaScript functions to
help manage the event. Each function must follow the best practices for defining
parameters, using return statements, and maintaining a single responsibility.
Instructions:
1. Task 1: Write a function to generate an attendee badge given a name and a
role (e.g., "speaker," "attendee").
○ Example Output: "Name: Alice, Role: Speaker"
2. Task 2: Write a function to calculate the total cost of the event given the
number of attendees and the cost per attendee. If the number of attendees
exceeds 100, apply a 10% discount to the total cost.
○ Example Input: calculateCost(120, 25)
○ Example Output: 2700
3. Task 3: Write a function to validate email addresses for attendee
registrations. The function should return true if the email contains "@" and
".", and false otherwise.
Groups Should Complete the Following Phases:
● Design Phase:
○ Brainstorm function requirements (parameters, return values).
○ Assign roles: one person writes pseudocode, another writes the initial
implementation, and others test/debug.
● Implementation Phase:
○ Write and refine the functions in a github repo.
1
● Testing Phase:
○ Each team member should write at least one test case for each
function.
● Presentation Phase:
○ Each group presents their functions to the class, explaining their
design choices and testing process.
